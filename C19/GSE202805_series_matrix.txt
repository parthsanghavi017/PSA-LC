!Series_summary	"The majority of patients with COVID-19 have a self-limiting upper respiratory tract infection mostly represented by asymptomatic or mild, however a small but relevant proportion of patients develops acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), characterised by an excessive, host immune response with overproduction of proinflammatory cytokines can rapidly lead to multi-organ failure and death. Indeed, immune pathologies are well characterised through deep immune phenotyping, plasma analysis, sc-RNA and chip based methylation analysis, still we lack a molecular understanding of immune pathologies associated with COVID-19 which is urgently needed for new prognostic and therapeutic interventions. In this study, we first time showed a SARS-Cov2 induced severity associated deregulation of immune functions driven through a global reprogramming of immune functions through a epigenetically driven gene regulatory network"
!Series_overall_design	"RNA sequencing was performed on a total of 80 PBMC samples derived from healthy controls (n = 10), acute-Mild (n = 4), Acute-Moderate (n = 6), Acute-Severe (n = 32) and Convalescent = 28"
